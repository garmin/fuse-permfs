# Keys in this section match any file or directory that is a direct child of
# the current directory by comparing the key against the child name
#
children:
  # Matches any file or direction that is a child of the current directory with
  # a name of "node". If the item is a directory, any attributes apply to the
  # directory and all it's children recursively. Otherwise, they only apply to
  # the file itself.
  #
  # Any attribute that is not specified is inherited from the parent
  node:
    # Set the owner to be UID 100. Must be an integer
    uid: 100

    # Set the group to be GID 100. Must be an integer
    gid: 100

    # If the item is a file, does nothing. If the item is a directory it is its
    # mode, and the mode applied to all child directories, recursively. Must be
    # an octal integer
    dmode: 0775

    # If the item is a file, this will be the mode. If the item is a directory,
    # it is the mode applied to all child non-directories, recursively. Must be
    # an octal integer
    fmode: 0664


  # The matching string can also be a pattern as match by man(3) fnmatch().
  # Quoting is necessary to prevent YAML thinking it is an anchor. Note that
  # patterns on non-directories only apply to the current children of this
  # directory (e.g. not recursive)
  "*.py":
    fmode: 0755

# The root permissions are defined with a special entry named "/" in the
# toplevel perm.yml file (since the root node doesn't have a parent). This
# effectively overrides the default permissions that permfs would apply if
# none are specified
